# Production Guide for Solo Game Developement

This guide collects ideas, tools and resources for the entire game production process - from first idea to final release - and can serve as a blueprint for beginners, or as an interesting insight into my personal developement process for [GHOSTS & GLITTER](https://www.youtube.com/@ghostsnglitter). It is created alongside my first game projects and will therefore be updated regularly - any input from experts is appreciated!

In detail, this guide will cover the different `Phases of Game Developement`, with specific information on the different goals, used tools, strategies for organization, as well as learning material and useful resources.

## Concept Phase

In the Concept Phase, you will funnel your many brainstormed game ideas into a single, clearly defined game concept and critically evaluate it. If you are satisfied, you will make the commitment to move into Pre-Production.

## Pre-Production

In Pre-Production, the most important design decisions are going to be hashed out. This happens in an iterative process of designing and prototyping. You will also consider the required resources and create a plan for the realization of your game - including a first timeline - so that you can move into Production.

## Production

In Production, the specified design will be implemented. This too is an interative process consisting of different stages, which may see the design being updated. The implementation is accompanied by consistent content preparation for public showcasing of the game - with increased commitment towards the release, which will mark the end of this phase.

## Post-Release

In Post-Release, the focus is on increasing engagement, as well as updating and improving the game. Depending on the type of game, additional content may be developed.
