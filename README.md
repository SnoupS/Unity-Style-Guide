## 1. Introduction

In this guide, you will find a complete documentation of my personal game development process for [GHOSTS & GLITTER](https://www.youtube.com/@ghostsnglitter) - from the first idea to the final release. If you are an aspiring indie game dev of any skill-level, this can serve as a blueprint and valuable reference. If you are a seasoned veteran, this may serve as little more than an interesting insight into my process - although any input from experts is welcome!

In detail, this guide will cover the different `Phases of Game Development`, with specific information on the different goals, tools used, strategies for organisation, as well as learning material and useful resources.

#### Important Notes
Before going further, a couple of important notes front-up:
- This guide covers game development in Unity (although this is only really important for the production phase)
- This guide is being written alongside the development of my first couple of game projects and will certainly see many updates

## 2. Phases of Game Development

This is the main part of the guide. What follows are short descriptions of the different phases of game development as i have defined them for myself, as well as links to the detailed articles.

### 2.1 Concept Phase

In the Concept Phase, you will funnel your many ideas into a single, clearly defined game concept and critically evaluate it. If you are satisfied, you will make the commitment to move into Pre-Production.

### 2.2 Pre-Production

During Pre-Production, you are going to hash out the most important design decisions. This is done through an iterative process of design and prototyping. You will also consider the resources that will be needed and draw up a plan for the realisation of your game - including an initial timeline - so that you can move on to Production.

### 2.3 Production

In Production, you will implement the specified design. This too is an interative process consisting of different stages, during which the design may need to be updated. The implementation is accompanied by consistent content preparation for public presentation of the game - with an increased commitment towards the release, which will mark the end of this phase.

### 2.4 Post-Release

The post-release period is all about increasing engagement, and working on updates and improvements. Depending on the game, additional content may be created.
