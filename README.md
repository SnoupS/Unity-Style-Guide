# Production Guide for Solo Game Development

This guide collects ideas, tools and resources for the entire game development process - from the first idea to the final release. It can serve as a blueprint for beginners or as an interesting insight into my personal process at [GHOSTS & GLITTER](https://www.youtube.com/@ghostsnglitter). Created alongside my first game project, it will be updated regularly - any input from experts is welcome!

In detail, this guide will cover the different `Phases of Game Development`, with specific information on the different goals, tools used, strategies for organisation, as well as learning material and useful resources.

## Concept Phase

In the Concept Phase, you will funnel your many brainstormed game ideas into a single, clearly defined game concept and critically evaluate it. If you are satisfied, you will make the commitment to move into Pre-Production.

## Pre-Production

During Pre-Production, you are going to hash out the most important design decisions. This is done through an iterative process of design and prototyping. You will also consider the resources that will be needed and draw up a plan for the realisation of your game - including an initial timeline - so that you can move on to Production.

## Production

In Production, you will implement the specified design. This too is an interative process consisting of different stages, during which the design may need to be updated. The implementation is accompanied by consistent content preparation for public presentation of the game - with an increased commitment towards the release, which will mark the end of this phase.

## Post-Release

The post-release period is all about increasing engagement, and working on updates and improvements. Depending on the game, additional content may be created.
